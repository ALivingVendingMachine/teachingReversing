# Hey zach, wtf is reversing?
- reversing is taking a binary and figuring out what it does only from looking at the assembly instructions that it performs
  - this is hard.  automated techniques can get close, but the human touch is still required
  - the. computer. doesn't. want. secrets.
    - every binary is comprehendable in some way

# Hey zach, wtf do I care?
- Number One: FREE POINTS ON CTFs
  - students specifically are bad at reversing because it takes time to learn and no one teaches it
    - this is my attempt to teach it

# Hey zach, wtf are we doing?
- week by week, I'm gonna work up to solving some crackmes, by covering different aspects of reversing
- by week 2-ish (this is week 0), I'll be giving sorta kinda homework
  - I don't care if you don't do it, I'm not the cops

# Hey zach, how tf do you know this?
- first, I'm sick
- second, I have a lot of time
  - what are you doing on the weekends, nerd?

# Show me the world, zach
